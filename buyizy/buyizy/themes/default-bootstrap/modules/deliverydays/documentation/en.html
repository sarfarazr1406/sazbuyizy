        <p>
          This is the simplest method, but it may not work in some cases. If this does not work, use the manual installation method presented below.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Modules tab, click to add a new module.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click Browse to open a dialog box that allows you to search in your computer, select the file and confirm the dialog box. Finally, click Download this module.
        </p>
        <p>
          The module will appear in your list of modules in the Module tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          Click the Install button to install the module.
        </p>
        <h4 id="installation_install_a_module_manually">
          Install a module manually
        </h4>
        <p>
          Use this method if the manual installation does not work. It may seem tedious, a priori, for beginners, because it requires some knowledge of FTP, etc., but it is no more complex and perhaps more convenient because it works every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the expertise required for installation is pretty basic and it is something that all store managers must master.
        </p>
        <p>
          To manually install a new PrestaShop module:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Unzip the module archive file (.zip). This should create a new folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using your FTP client, place the folder in your PrestaShop folder /modules. Be careful to not upload this folder into the folder of another module (which can happen when you drag elements). Download the entire folder, not just the files in it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go to your back office, in the tab "Modules".
          </li>
          <li>
            Locate the new module in the module list. You may have to scroll.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click the Install button to install the module.
          </li>
